# Livingston Destriers Code
This repository is to store the code for the FTC team made in Livingston High School in Livingston, New Jersey. This partnership is based on the principals of the Living Bridge and will hopefully last for a long time. This repository will have the code for each year's competition, as well as the CAD files and their evolutions, the website's source code, and any other files which would require overseas collaboration.
